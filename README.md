#   Introduction
This repositiory provides the necessary drivers to collect end effector data from a 7-DOF Force Dimension Haptic Device for remote teleoperation of a Denso robotic arm. 
The necessary end effector torques on the robotic arm are converted to the reactive forces on the haptic device. There is a forward and inverse kinematics tool transcribed
to do this conversion in real-time.
